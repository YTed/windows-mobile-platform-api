This is a UI framework for windows mobile, not finished, and seems will never be.

The framework design in a Java swing-style listener event system instead of C# embeded delegate, as well as layout manager style instead of designer generated codes.

I wrote this framework mainly for alpha blending and transparency control, which either is not supported on windows mobile .NET Framework Compact, or hard to use.

I knew that windows mobile is almost died, but still release this in case of somebody struggling in the hell.

Also, there is a bug in the control size and position calculating, which is fatal to some situation.

Good luck.
